Bells and Whistles: 
- Monster Variety (rat, bunny, bird)
- More Dastardly Monsters (diffeent amount of potions for each)
- Level Up and Fight Again (5 extra points each time the monster is defeated)
- Beautification (styles and images)
- Something of your own design (Some of the Art work and animations done by me, the randomification of the potions and attacks)


Bugs I've encountered:
- The pointRemaining var was very hard to figure out. It couldn't go under 0, it had to decrease and increase with the attributes and it had to go to the next screen when it reached 0. 
- If the player strength is 0 and the player energy is 0 move to the defeat screen
- if the player health is 0 move to the defeat screen
- the defeat screena and the final victory screens should reset the enire app
- the middle victories should reset the heal to 1 and should move on to the point buff screen then to the next monster 

Rules:
- In this game, you are a cat trying to beat 3 monsters.
- use the three given abalities to run through the monsters with diffrent, health, strength, and potions.
- if you claw the monster, it will fight you back, if you pounce the monster, it will throw a potion at you and when it runs out of potions it will use the strength instead.
- You can only heal once per round, so when a new monster is generated, you will gain 1 heal point. 
- When you run out of strength and energy, you lose, bc you have no more attacks left. 

Game recommendations: (spoilers, dont look unless you have played it!)
- Can't get to the ending? : Try spending the points for health much less -
- for example for the first time playing making the health 70 and spend the rest on the power. Then just heal before fighting to gain 20 HP
- Continue to do this with the 5 point buff as well and just heal before every round. This will guarantee that you reach the ending. 

- Can't stop winning? : Just spend all you points on the powers and click attack to get your health to 0, this will show the defeat screen and restart the game.
